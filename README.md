## About

**Arachne** is a modular real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for AI-native workloads. It is built from scratch to support compiler-aware OS design and efficient on-device machine learning.

---

## Features

- Modular, preemptive kernel
- Deterministic task scheduling for real-time AI inference
- Compiler-aware runtime hooks
- Lightweight threading and message-passing
- Real-time memory management for concurrent workloads
- Simulated peripheral support (UART, timers, GPIO)


---

## Technologies

- Languages: C++, x86-64 Assembly
- Platform: Bare-metal, QEMU-compatible x86
- Build System: Make, NASM, LD
---

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Cross-compiler toolchain for x86_64
- QEMU or real hardware
- `make`, `nasm`, `ld`, `gcc`

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harris2001/Arachne
make run
```

### Run

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel build/boot.bin
```
