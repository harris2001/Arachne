## About

**Arachne** is a custom OS designed from scratch for high-performance, concurrent systems. It focuses on lightweight threading, and async-first design. Think of it as a playground for modern systems programming ‚Äî low overhead, modular, and really dead simple.

---

## Features

- Microkernel architecture
- Lightweight user-space threads (fibers)
- Lock-free message-passing concurrency
- Fast context switching
- Minimal syscall interface
- Designed for bare-metal performance

---

## Architecture

- **Kernel Type**: Microkernel
- **Concurrency Model**: Message-passing and async-first
- **Threading**: Custom scheduler with fibers and cooperative multitasking
- **Memory Management**: Paging with minimal kernel memory footprint
- **Target Arch**: x86_64 (more coming)

---

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Cross-compiler toolchain for x86_64
- QEMU or real hardware
- `make`, `nasm`, `ld`, `gcc`

### Build

```bash
make
```

### Run

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel build/boot.bin
```
